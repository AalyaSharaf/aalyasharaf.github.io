		<p class="text">The main concept of our group's film was coffee! The inspiration itself came from our surroundings. Being near a coffee shop, there were naturally lots of students with coffee cups. The aim was to try to get an identical shot of them drinking their coffees and then putting together all the snapshots to form one cohesive video.</p>
